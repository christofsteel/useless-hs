Useless
=======

Useless is a Haskell Application Server. 
It allows you to build, run and manage applications that are written in Haskell.
It currently only delivers HTTP/1.0 sites and is not quite standard compliance to HTTP, but current web clients should be able to process responses from Useless applications.

---

To compile and install Useless use:

$ cabal install

---

To build a web application, just import Useless.
Example:

import Useless

main = do
  theServer <- initUseless
  theServer <- register "/" (foobar "A String") theServer
  startServer 8080 theServer

foobar :: String -> UselessSite
foobar s useless req = return HTTPResponse 
  { httpResStatus = 200
  , httpResHeader = []
  , httpResBody = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>"++ s ++"</title></head><body>You are using "++httpReqVersion req++", but I'm ignoring that, sorry :(</body></html>"
  }
