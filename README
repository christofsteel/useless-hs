Useless
=======

Useless is a Haskell Application Server. 
It allows you to build, run and manage applications that are written in Haskell.
It currently only delivers HTTP/1.0 sites and is not quite standard compliance to HTTP, but current web clients should be able to process responses from Useless applications.

---

To compile and install Useless use:

$ cabal install

---

To build a web application, just import Useless.
Example:
see examples/ for examples
